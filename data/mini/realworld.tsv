I like your short	I like your shirt
He are going home	He is going home
I will sea you later	I will see you later
We need to by more	We need to buy more
The dessert was to sweet	The dessert was too sweet
She red the book	She read the book
Turn left at the write	Turn left at the right
I left my keys on the flour	I left my keys on the floor
The company raised a new round of found	The company raised a new round of funding
Their is a problem with the code	There is a problem with the code
